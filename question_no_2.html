  <p>This lesson is about computer games. It gives learners a chance to express their opinions about gaming. There are opportunities to personalise the lesson for your learners by giving them the chance to design their own quiz and do a class survey to find out about the gaming habits of the class.

    A reading text will stretch higher level students and can be used as a basis for discussion on the possible dangers of playing violent games. Quotes from people within the gaming world can also be used to provoke debate and to get students to express their own opinions on the influence of computer games. Younger students with good imaginations have the chance in the final task to design their own game.</p>
